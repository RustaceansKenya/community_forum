    The videos on youtube are incomplete. While editing them I realized that I was wrong in some explanations. I would not wish to spread rumours. 
    It's better to just write a book that can be corrected any time.  
    (I explained ABI wrongly... I still do not know the scope of what ABI entails haha)
